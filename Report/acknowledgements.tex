We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our mentor faculty, Kshitiz Verma who gave us a chance to perpetrate this project under his tutelage on this growing field of Machine Learning, we thank him for his constant support, clear answers and helping us improve this project along the way.
It would also be unjust to not thank Andrew Ng, Harrison Kinsley and numerous other creators and tutors on their amazing video or text based lectures and in-depth illustrations of Machine Learning, without which, it would've been impossible to accomplish this project. 
We would also like to thank our seniors and peers at LNMIIT, who helped us correct every silly bug and made us easily understand those notorious computations with the silliest analogies.
This project has inspired us to commit to more such projects in the future in this field of Science and we're more than determined to continue along this path, thanks to all of our supporters and well wishers.
