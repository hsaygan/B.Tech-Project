\section{The Area of Work}
Our area of work will specifically be directed towards analyzing and extracting data. We'll be focusing on finding patterns are relation of phrases and words towards positive or negative sentiments of online comments, posts and tweets of the comentee.
 


\section{Problem Overview}
The recent boom of online social media creates a giant void of making content be meaningful, to machines along with humans. Social Media giants like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit etc. all need this data analyzed to filter out inappropriate content, categorization of posts along with numerous other applications. 
This gap between Hundreds of Terabytes of unrecognized data can be understood using Natural Language Processing, and for the specific problem we discussed, Sentimental Data Analysis hits the key goal.

\section{Existing System}
Existing systems include implementation of NLP using Python and R. Many of them use outdated C and C++ hard-coded programs that fail to follow Open-Close principle and hence are locked for further improvement.
However, there do exists systems which use NLP and Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Our project prospects to work and hopefully improve the existing standard using more metrics and expandability with the help of Neural Networks and reinforced learning.
