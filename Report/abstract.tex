Sentimental Data Analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention. Using Neural Networks and other Machine Learning techniques, we can extract features, words and expressions that directly correlate to the respective writer's emotions. 
To determine the same, we extract data from tweets and other articles, and use TensorFlow to implement and TensorBoard to visualize the Neural Network propagation and extract the true weight of a phrase and it's correlation to a positive or negative sentiment.
